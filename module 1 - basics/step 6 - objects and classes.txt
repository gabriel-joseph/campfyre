Objects are a data type offered by some languages, but the principles of objects are useful.
Objects are things. They can have attributes, called properties/fields corresponding to data types and methods, which are functions assigned to an object/class. 
Similar to dictionaries, properties/method names must be unique.



// object describing an event
concert = {
    nameOfEvent:"Lollapalooza",
    attendance:60000,
    location:"Chicago" // properties can be single values
    vendors:["Coke","Five Guys","Shelby's"], // properties can be lists
}

cruise = {
    attendance:6000,
    nameOfEvent:"Disney Cruise",
    location:"Atlantic" // properties can be single values
    vendors:["Disney","Caesar's Casino","Sony","Apple"], // properties can be lists
}


concert.name // get "Lollapalooza"



Classes are instructions/blueprints for Objects. They define what shapes object have and their core purpose.
Objects are created when a class is instantiated, usually with a constructor.

class Event {
    // what makes up an event?
    attendance:number
    nameOfEvent:string
    location:string
    vendors:string[]

    constructor(attendance:number){
        this.attendance = attendance
        ...
    }
}


grammys = new Event(attendance:500)
grammys = new Event(500)
