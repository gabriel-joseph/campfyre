Functions are callable tasks. They contain instructions, kind of like mini-programs. They execute top to bottom. 
Functions vary by language, but they are typically written like this:

function signUp(){
    print("You are signed up!")
}

This is the function declaration. They are called by their declaration:

signUp() // this would print "You are signed up!"

Arguments can be optionally be declared in the function.

function signUp(name:string){
    print("Congrats",name,"!")
    print("You are signed up!")
}

Fucntions are declared and assigned, similar to variables, with the key difference that they can be called to execute the tasks inside.

signUp("Megan")
signUp("Jason")
