Hardware is the physical components that make up computers
- Motherboard, processor, RAM
Software is the instructions and programs that tell hardware and other softwware what to do
- OS, browser, command line, file explorer, applications
Computer Science is the study of how data is computed (handled, stored, operated on) by machines
- Programming languages, low-level/abstraction practices, kernels, algorithms, data structures
Engineers design and develop solutions based on applied sciences/mathetatics. 
- Chemical engineers use periodic table to design and develop solutions based on the laws of chemistry, elements, etc.
- Aerospace engineers use math and physics to design and deploy
* note - engineers USE science and math, they do not need to prove laws/science each time they use them or reinvent the wheel
* Chemical engineers don't need to memorize periodic table or know every element's proton numbers, but they do need to know that each element has a unique number of protons
* Software engineers don't need to know every language, data structure, algo, etc. but they do need to understand basics (such as data addresses in memory)

How do engineers write instructions? Languages 


Action:
When the car turns on, set the temperature to 70 and turn the screen on. After 3 seconds, play a chime and print the fuel level.

Code:

turn_on_car()
set temp = 70
screen_on = True
wait(3)
play_chime()
print_fuel(car.get_current_fuel())

Machine code:

1X3209 X98 BUFR % 79
210==78
