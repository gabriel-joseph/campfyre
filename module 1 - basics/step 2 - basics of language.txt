Languages are how things communicate. They usually follow linguistic patterns and rules (grammer).
Programming languages differ in syntax and purpose, but they usually have some core characteristics:

1. They are written into files and the extension denotes the language
- *.sql,*.js,*.go
2. The language itself is maintained by an entity and is downloaded onto machines
- Java from Orcale/Java, Python from Python.org
3. Files are "run" by following the language's lifecycle/nature (such as interpretation, compilation, deployment)
- Java is compiled and then run, Python is interpreted, JavaScript can be run on browsers/Node
4. Languages have keywords and the language understands code based on syntax and keywords
- class, var, boolean, Map are designated keywords for a language and the language will expect certain syntax with those words
5. Languages print information for developers to inform and educate
- Throwing errors and exceptions instead of crashing
6. They are versioned (different features)
- Python 2, Python 3.6, Python 3.11
7. Comments!
 - # comments in python, // in java, // in javascript
