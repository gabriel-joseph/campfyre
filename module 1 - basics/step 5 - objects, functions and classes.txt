Objects are a data type offered by some languages, but the principles of objects are useful.
Objects are things. They can have attributes, called properties/fields corresponding to data types and methods, which are functions assigned to an object/class. Similar to dictionaries, properties/method names must be unique.

// object describing an event
{
    name:"Lollapalooza",
    attendance:60000,
    location:"Chicago" // properties can be single values
    vendors:["Coke","Five Guys","Shelby's"], // properties can be lists
    signup:(name,address) => { // method, see more below
        print("hello")
        print(name)
        print("we are sending tickets to")
        print(address)
        print("see you at the show")
    }

}

In coding, we have 2 different ways of writing callable blocks of instructions/tasks. 
Functions refer to a callable block that will usually execute from top to bottom.

function greeting(){
    
}


Methods are blocks of code attached to objects that can be called to. 

Classes are instructions/blueprints for Objects. They define what shapes object have and their core purpose.
Objects are created when a class is instantiated, usually with a constructor.
