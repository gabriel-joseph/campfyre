Java was created in 1996 by Sun systems.
In 2009 Sun Systems was aquired by oracle, who has maintained the development of Java.

Java is OOP and strictly typed, so there's a bit of rules/syntax to learn.




public class FirstJavaClass {

For general use, simply download a JDK from either source (or homebrew/Chocolatey)

But before we download Java, open a terminal and type "java". If your computer doesn't have Java, you should get an error.
This is your first experience with what happens when you try to access/use a language before it is installed.
